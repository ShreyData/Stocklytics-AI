# Stocklytics AI

Stocklytics AI is a retail operations platform for small and medium stores. It combines inventory management, billing, customer records, alerts, analytics, and a grounded AI assistant in one workspace built for day-to-day store operations.

The project is implemented as a modular monolith backend with a modern Next.js frontend, and it is designed to run well on Google Cloud using Firestore, BigQuery, Cloud Run, and Gemini models.

## Overview

Stocklytics AI helps a retail operator answer practical questions such as:

- What products are low on stock?
- Which items are expiring soon?
- What sold best today?
- Which customers are buying the most?
- What should I restock next?
- What changed in the business since the last update?

Instead of splitting those jobs across multiple tools, the platform keeps operational data, analytics snapshots, and AI guidance in one system.

At a high level:

- `frontend/` provides the operator-facing web app
- `backend/` provides the API, auth, domain logic, analytics access, alerts, and AI services
- `infra/cloudrun/` contains deployment templates for Google Cloud Run and Cloud Build
- `backend/scripts/` contains seeding, sync, transform, and E2E helper scripts

## Core Features

- Retail dashboard with sales, transactions, alert counts, and stock health
- Inventory management with create, update, stock adjustments, and low-stock workflows
- Billing and transaction creation with idempotency protection
- Customer management with profile creation and purchase history
- Alerts engine for low stock, expiry risk, high demand, and non-selling products
- Analytics views backed by BigQuery mart tables
- Grounded AI assistant that answers using live store context and retrieval-augmented product evidence
- Authenticated multi-user access using Firebase Authentication and backend claim validation
- Cloud-ready deployment model for frontend and backend as separate services

## Product Modules

The backend is organized into domain modules, each with its own router, schemas, service, and repository layer where appropriate.

### Inventory

- Product CRUD
- Stock adjustment tracking
- Reorder threshold monitoring
- Expiry metadata and inventory status handling

### Billing

- Transaction creation
- Stock deduction during billing
- Idempotency handling to prevent duplicate charges
- Integration with downstream analytics and alert workflows

### Customers

- Customer profile creation and listing
- Purchase history lookup
- Data used by both analytics and AI assistant features

### Alerts

- Low stock alert generation
- Expiry-soon and expired-item monitoring
- Not-selling and high-demand detection
- Acknowledge and resolve workflows

### Analytics

- Dashboard summary
- Sales trends
- Product performance
- Customer insights
- Freshness metadata for downstream consumers

### AI

- Chat sessions with persisted message history
- Grounded retrieval from inventory, analytics, alerts, customers, and transactions
- Product embedding sync into BigQuery
- Multi-model routing for fast answers and deeper reasoning

### Data Pipeline

- Incremental sync from Firestore to BigQuery raw tables
- Mart transformations for analytics views
- Failure tracking and repair workflows
- Admin-triggered sync endpoints

## AI Assistant

The AI assistant is designed for operational retail questions, not open-ended general chat.

Current design goals:

- Answer from store data instead of generic LLM behavior
- Use exact and semantic product retrieval for product-specific questions
- Keep deeper reasoning on Gemini-class models to avoid slow model hops
- Keep simple operational questions fast with `gemini-2.0-flash`
- Return answer provenance such as intent, retrieval confidence, and grounding metadata
- Fall back gracefully when parts of the context are unavailable

Current backend AI flow includes:

1. Query intent detection
2. Selective context loading
3. Hybrid retrieval using Firestore snapshots plus BigQuery vector search
4. Evidence-pack prompt construction
5. Model routing and answer generation
6. Response normalization and persistence

Relevant AI endpoints:

- `POST /api/v1/ai/chat`
- `GET /api/v1/ai/chat/sessions/{chat_session_id}`
- `POST /api/v1/ai/embed-sync`

## Architecture

The backend follows a modular monolith style. Each domain lives inside `backend/app/modules/<domain>/`.

Common backend layering pattern:

- `router.py`
  FastAPI endpoints and request validation
- `schemas.py`
  Pydantic request/response models
- `service.py`
  Business logic and orchestration
- `repository.py`
  Firestore or BigQuery access

Shared backend infrastructure lives in:

- `backend/app/common/`
  config, auth, middleware, exceptions, logging, shared response helpers
- `backend/app/api/`
  platform and administrative endpoints

The frontend is a Next.js App Router application. Pages live under `frontend/app/`, shared components under `frontend/components/`, and runtime/service helpers under `frontend/lib/`.

### Backend Request Flow

Typical API request flow:

1. Request enters FastAPI app at [main.py](/run/media/shrey/Data/Team%20369/Solution%20Challenge/Stocklytics-AI/backend/app/main.py:1)
2. Middleware attaches request metadata and logging context
3. Firebase-backed auth validates the bearer token and extracts role/store claims
4. Router validates payload and delegates to a domain service
5. Service coordinates repositories, rules, downstream reads, and persistence
6. Standard response helper injects `request_id`

### Frontend Runtime Modes

The frontend supports multiple runtime modes via [runtime.ts](/run/media/shrey/Data/Team%20369/Solution%20Challenge/Stocklytics-AI/frontend/lib/runtime.ts:1):

- `firebase`
  Real Firebase web authentication
- `backend_stub_auth`
  Real backend with local stub auth when Firebase web config is absent
- `mock_api`
  Fully mocked frontend preview mode

This makes it easier to develop independently across backend, frontend, and cloud environments.

## Google Cloud and Firebase Usage

This project is tightly integrated with Google services.

### Firebase

- Firebase Authentication for operator sign-in
- Firebase Admin SDK on backend for token verification
- Custom claims (`role`, `store_id`) used for store-scoped authorization

### Firestore

- Primary operational datastore
- Stores products, customers, transactions, stock adjustments, alerts, metadata, and AI chat sessions
- Supports the real-time store state used by API modules and AI retrieval

### BigQuery

- Raw tables for synced operational data
- Mart tables for analytics summaries and reporting views
- Product embedding storage for vector search
- Retrieval source for analytics and AI grounding

### Gemini / Google AI

- Query embeddings using `gemini-embedding-001`
- Fast chat generation using Gemini Flash-class models
- Deeper reasoning stays on configured Gemini-class models
- Used by the AI assistant only after context is assembled from operational data

### Cloud Run

- `stocklytics-backend` runs the FastAPI API
- `stocklytics-frontend` runs the Next.js standalone app
- Separate deployment surface keeps backend and frontend scaling concerns clean

### Cloud Build

- Builds backend and frontend images
- Injects environment-specific build/runtime configuration during deployment

### Artifact Registry

- Stores backend and frontend container images for Cloud Run deployment

## Deployment

Cloud deployment assets live in `infra/cloudrun/`.

Read the detailed cloud guide here:

- [infra/cloudrun/README.md](/run/media/shrey/Data/Team%20369/Solution%20Challenge/Stocklytics-AI/infra/cloudrun/README.md:1)

Deployment model:

- Backend deployed as a Cloud Run FastAPI service
- Frontend deployed as a Cloud Run Next.js service
- Images built with Cloud Build and stored in Artifact Registry

Production recommendation:

- Prefer Cloud Run service account permissions over injecting raw private keys
- Use Secret Manager for sensitive runtime values where possible
- Grant backend service account Firestore and BigQuery roles explicitly

## Operational Scripts

Useful backend scripts in `backend/scripts/`:

- `seed_one_month_data.py`
  Seeds demo-style retail data
- `reset_and_seed_one_month_data.py`
  Clears one store, reseeds one month, rebuilds alerts, analytics, and embeddings
- `run_sync_job.py`
  Runs Firestore to BigQuery sync
- `run_transform_job.py`
  Builds mart tables from raw data
- `run_embedding_sync.py`
  Regenerates product embeddings
- `run_alerts_sweep.py`
  Recomputes alerts from operational state
- `run_repair_job.py`
  Repairs pipeline failures

## Security Notes

- Do not commit service-account JSON files, local auth key notes, or real env files
- Prefer Application Default Credentials on Cloud Run over shipping long-lived private keys
- Rotate any Firebase or Google Cloud credentials immediately if they are ever exposed
- Keep `infra/cloudrun/*.env.yaml` local and out of git
- Review `.gitignore` and `.gcloudignore` before deployment so local secrets are excluded but build-critical source files are included

## Roadmap Ideas

- Stronger admin workflows for store and user provisioning
- Better observability around AI latency, retrieval quality, and model routing
- Richer analytics slices and drill-downs
- Automated CI validation for backend, frontend, and deployment health
- Secret Manager integration for all production-sensitive settings
